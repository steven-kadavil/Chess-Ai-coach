Tasks:
1) Locate all files/modules affected by the issue. List paths and why each is implicated.
2) Explain the root cause(s): what changed, how it propagates to the failure, and any environmental factors.
3) Propose the minimal, safe fix. Include code-level steps, side effects, and tests to add/update.
4) Flag any missing or outdated documentation/configs/schemas that should be updated or added (especially if code appears outdated vs. current behavior). Specify exact docs/sections to create or amend.

Output format:

- Proposed fix:
  - <steps/patch outline>
